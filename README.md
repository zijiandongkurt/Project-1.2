# Project 1-2 Putting - Group 19

This repository contains source code for group 19 collaboration on UM 
DKE 2022 semester project 1-2. The goal of the project is creation of
a simplified putting game simulator, including simplified physics 
modeling using numerical function approximation, 3d representation, 
interface for human player, AI bot capable of winning the game and 
more details of lesser importance. 

The project schedule contains three phases (iterations). First phase 
implies creation of the physics engine using the most basic 
approximation (basic Euler method for finding function value using its
derivative and previous value), simple visualization and human player
interface. Second phase implies complete visualization, advanced physics 
modeling methods and a couple of AI implementations capable of winning 
the game. Third and last phase implies introduction of obstacles and 
creating an AI that would be able to win the game in a maze-like 
environment
